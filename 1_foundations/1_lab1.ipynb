      "### I. Core Development & Engineering Roles\n",
      "\n",
      "These roles are at the heart of building, optimizing, and deploying agentic systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Agentic AI Engineer / Multi-Agent Systems Engineer:**\n",
      "    *   **What they do:** Design, develop, and implement the core architecture of AI agents, including planning modules, memory systems, tool-use capabilities, and multi-agent coordination frameworks. They work with LLMs, but also build the surrounding infrastructure that makes them *agentic*.\n",
      "    *   **Why it's worth it:** This is the direct application of cutting-edge research into practical systems. High demand, complex problems, and direct impact on agent performance.\n",
      "    *   **Skills:** Strong programming (Python, C++), deep understanding of AI/ML, distributed systems, reinforcement learning, prompt engineering for agents, API integration, knowledge graphs.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **AI Solutions Architect (Agentic Focus):**\n",
      "    *   **What they do:** Design end-to-end agentic solutions for specific business problems. They bridge the gap between business needs and technical capabilities, defining the overall system architecture, choosing the right models/tools, and ensuring scalability, security, and ethical considerations.\n",
      "    *   **Why it's worth it:** High-level strategic role with significant influence. Requires both deep technical knowledge and strong business acumen.\n",
      "    *   **Skills:** System design, cloud architecture, AI/ML expertise, business analysis, communication, project management.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Prompt Engineer (Agentic Focus) / Agent Orchestration Specialist:**\n",
      "    *   **What they do:** Go beyond simple prompt writing. They design sophisticated prompting strategies and orchestration layers to guide agents through complex tasks, manage their sub-goals, facilitate tool use, and handle self-correction. They're like the \"director\" for AI agents.\n",
      "    *   **Why it's worth it:** As agentic systems become more complex, optimizing their behavior through clever prompting and meta-prompting is crucial. This is a highly specialized skill set.\n",
      "    *   **Skills:** Deep understanding of LLM capabilities and limitations, creative problem-solving, understanding of agentic design patterns (e.g., ReAct, Chain-of-Thought), scripting.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Full-Stack Developer (Agentic Applications):**\n",
      "    *   **What they do:** Build the user-facing applications and back-end infrastructure that interact with and leverage AI agents. This includes UIs for agent interaction, dashboards for monitoring, and APIs for agent communication.\n",
      "    *   **Why it's worth it:** Agentic AI needs interfaces and integration points to be truly useful. This role ensures the agents can be deployed and used effectively by humans or other systems.\n",
      "    *   **Skills:** Frontend (React, Vue, Angular), Backend (Node.js, Python/FastAPI), API development, database management, cloud services.\n",

      "1.  **AI Researcher (Agentic Systems / Cognitive Architectures):**\n",

      "    *   **Why it's worth it:** At the forefront of innovation. High intellectual challenge and potential for groundbreaking discoveries. Often requires a Ph.D.\n",
      "    *   **Skills:** Advanced mathematics, deep learning, reinforcement learning, cognitive science, strong research publication record.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **AI Safety & Alignment Engineer/Researcher:**\n",
      "    *   **What they do:** Focus on ensuring agentic systems are safe, reliable, and aligned with human values and intentions. This involves developing methods for robust testing, preventing unintended consequences, ensuring ethical behavior, and creating mechanisms for human oversight and control.\n",
      "    *   **Why it's worth it:** This is arguably *the most critical* long-term area. As agents gain more autonomy, safety and alignment become paramount. High impact and growing demand.\n",
      "    *   **Skills:** AI/ML, ethics, formal methods, game theory, robust control theory, risk assessment.\n",

      "These roles focus on bringing agentic AI solutions to market and solving real-world problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **AI Product Manager (Agentic Products):**\n",
